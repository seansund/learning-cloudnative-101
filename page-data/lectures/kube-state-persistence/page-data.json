First, when a Container crashes, kubelet will restart it, but the files will be lost - the Container starts with a clean state. Second, when running Containers together in a Pod it is often necessary to share files between those Containers. The Kubernetes Volume abstraction solves both of these problems.\n\nDocker also has a concept of volumes, though it is somewhat looser and less managed. In Docker, a volume is simply a directory on disk or in another Container.\n\nA Kubernetes volume, on the other hand, has an explicit lifetime - the same as the Pod that encloses it. Consequently, a volume outlives any Containers that run within the Pod, and data is preserved across Container restarts. Of course, when a Pod ceases to exist, the volume will cease to exist, too. Perhaps more importantly than this, Kubernetes supports many types of volumes, and a Pod can use any number of them simultaneously.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n**OpenShift**\n- [Volume Lifecycle](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html#lifecycle-volume-claim_understanding-persistent-storage)\n\n**IKS**\n- [Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)\n\n\n## References\n\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - image: busybox\n    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo Hello Kubernetes! && sleep 3600']\n    name: busybox\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /cache\n      name: cache-volume\n  volumes:\n  - name: cache-volume\n    emptyDir: {}\n```\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Pod\nmetadata:\n  name: test-pd\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - image: bitnami/nginx\n    name: test-container\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: /test-pd\n      name: test-volume\n  volumes:\n  - name: test-volume\n    hostPath:\n      # directory location on host\n      path: /data\n      # this field is optional\n      type: Directory\n```\n\n# PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims\n\nManaging storage is a distinct problem from managing compute instances. The PersistentVolume subsystem provides an API for users and administrators that abstracts details of how storage is provided from how it is consumed.\n\nA PersistentVolume (PV) is a piece of storage in the cluster that has been provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using Storage Classes.\n\nA PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) is a request for storage by a user. It is similar to a Pod. Pods consume node resources and PVCs consume PV resources. Claims can request specific size and access modes (e.g., they can be mounted once read/write or many times read-only).\n\nWhile PersistentVolumeClaims allow a user to consume abstract storage resources, it is common that users need PersistentVolumes with varying properties, such as performance, for different problems. Cluster administrators need to be able to offer a variety of PersistentVolumes that differ in more ways than just size and access modes, without exposing users to the details of how those volumes are implemented. For these needs, there is the StorageClass resource.\n\nPods access storage by using the claim as a volume. Claims must exist in the same namespace as the Pod using the claim. The cluster finds the claim in the Pod’s namespace and uses it to get the PersistentVolume backing the claim. The volume is then mounted to the host and into the Pod.\n\nPersistentVolumes binds are exclusive, and since PersistentVolumeClaims are namespaced objects, mounting claims with “Many” modes (ROX, RWX) is only possible within one namespace.\n\n\n\n## Resources\n**OpenShift**\n- [Persistent Storage](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html)\n- [Persistent Volume Types](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/understanding-persistent-storage.html#types-of-persistent-volumes_understanding-persistent-storage)\n- [Expanding Peristent Volumes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.3/storage/expanding-persistent-volumes.html)\n\n**IKS**\n- [Persistent Volumes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)\n- [Writing Portable Configurations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#writing-portable-configuration)\n- [Configuring Persistent Volume Storage](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-persistent-volume-storage/)\n\n## References\n\n```yaml\nkind: PersistentVolume\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pv\nspec:\n  storageClassName: local-storage\n  capacity:\n    storage: 128Mi\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  hostPath:\n    path: \"/mnt/data-1\"\n```\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: PersistentVolumeClaim\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pvc\nspec:\n  storageClassName: local-storage\n  accessModes:\n    - ReadWriteOnce\n  resources:\n    requests:\n      storage: 100Mi\n```\n\n```yaml\nkind: Pod\napiVersion: v1\nmetadata:\n  name: my-pod\nspec:\n  containers:\n  - name: nginx\n    image: busybox\n    command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo $(date):$HOSTNAME Hello Kubernetes! >> /mnt/data/message.txt && sleep 3600']\n    volumeMounts:\n    - mountPath: \"/mnt/data\"\n      name: my-data\n  volumes:\n  - name: my-data\n    persistentVolumeClaim:\n      claimName: my-pvc\n```\n\n<Tabs>\n\n  <Tab label=\"OpenShift\">\n\n  **Getting the Persistent Volumes in Project** \n  ```\n    oc get pv \n  ```\n  **Getting the Persistent Volume Claims ** \n  ```\n    oc get pvc\n  ```\n  **Getting a specific Persistent Volume** \n  ```\n    oc get pv <pv-claim>\n  ```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n  <Tab label=\"IKS\">\n\n  **Getting the PersistentVolume ** \n  ```\n    kubectl get pv\n  ```\n  **Getting the PersistentVolumeClaims ** \n  ```\n    kubectl get pvc\n  ```\n\n  </Tab>\n\n</Tabs>\n\n## Activities\n\n| Task                            | Description         | Link        |\n| --------------------------------| ------------------  |:----------- |\n| *** Try It Yourself ***                         |         |    \n| Setting up Persistent Volumes | Create a Persistent Volume that's accessible from a SQL Pod. | [Setting up Persistent Volumes](../kube-overview/activities/labs/lab10) |\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5aecfbd7b721caa2a299c32cf1f6b0d7","counter":572,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"exports":[],"rawBody":"---\ntitle: State Persistence\ndescription: Persisting State in Kubernetes\n---\n\n<AnchorLinks small>\n  <AnchorLink>Volumes</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>Activities</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n# Volumes\n\nOn-disk files in a Container are ephemeral, which presents some problems for non-trivial applications when running in Containers.
